Svn
===

The Svn plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your
bcfg2 repository using a `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_
backend. It deprecates the previous Subversion integration mentioned here
at ftp://ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/bcfg/papers/directing-change-with-bcfg2.pdf.

Currently, It enables you to get revision information out of your
repository for reporting purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time
a client checks in, it will include the current repository revision in
the reports/statistics.

Future plans are to commit changes to the repo which are made by the
server (adding clients, ssh keys, etc).

How to enable the Svn plugin
============================

Simply add Svn to your plugins line in /etc/bcfg2.conf::

    [server]
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,DBStats,Decisions,Metadata,NagiosGen,Pkgmgr,Probes,Rules,SSHbase,TGenshi,Svn
