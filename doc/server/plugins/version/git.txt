Why use the Git plugin
======================

The Git plugin is useful if you would like to track changes to your bcfg2
repository using a `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ backend. Currently,
It enables you to get revision information out of your repository for
reporting purposes. Once the plugin is enabled, every time a client
checks in, it will include the current repository revision in the
reports/statistics.

Future plans are to commit changes to the repo which are made by the
server (adding clients, ssh keys, etc).

How to enable the Git plugin
============================

The Git plugin uses `Dulwich <http://samba.org/~jelmer/dulwich/>`_ to
interface with git repositories. Therefore, you will need to install
Dulwich on the bcfg2 server first. Once installed, simply add Git to
your plugins line in /etc/bcfg2.conf::

    [server]
    plugins = Base,Bundler,Cfg,...,Git
