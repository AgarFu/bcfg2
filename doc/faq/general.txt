FAQ: General
============

**What does Bcfg2 stand for?**

Initially, Bcfg stood for the bundle configuration system. Bcfg2 is the
second major revision. At this point, the acronym is meaningless, but
the name has stuck. Luckily, Bcfg2 googles better than Bcfg does. No,
seriously. Try it. All I know is that I have no interest in a billion
cubic feet of gas.

**What architectures does Bcfg2 support?**

Bcfg2 should run on any POSIX compatible operating system, however direct
support for an operating system's package and service formats are limited
by the currently available :ref:`client-tools-index` (although new client
tools are pretty easy to add). The following is an incomplete but more
exact list of platforms on which Bcfg2 works.

* GNU/Linux deb based distros
* GNU/Linux rpm based distros
* Solaris pkg based
* Gentoo portage based
* OSX (POSIX/launchd support)
